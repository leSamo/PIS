A sample Jakarta EE project demonstrating its basic concepts:

- JPA entities (see [data](https://github.com/DIFS-Teaching/jakartaee-basic/tree/main/rest-api/src/main/java/cz/vut/fit/pis/data))
- CDI beans (see [service](https://github.com/DIFS-Teaching/jakartaee-basic/tree/main/rest-api/src/main/java/cz/vut/fit/pis/service))
- GraphQL API using mp-graphql (see [graphql](https://github.com/DIFS-Teaching/jakartaee-basic/tree/main/rest-api/src/main/java/cz/vut/fit/pis/graphql))
